Story number and name: 1 - Extend user profile detail with usage
Story points: 3
Brief description to see the story in action: When viewing the details of a user, the user detail page should efficiently showcase their engagement by featuring thumbnails of the most recently uploaded photo and the photo with the most comments (upload date and comment count, respectively). Clicking on these thumbnails will direct users to a detailed view where the photo and its comments are prominently displayed, enhancing user interaction with the content.


Story number and name: 10 - Photo Stepper
Story points: 3
Brief description to see the story in action: photo collection. To improve usability, implement a photo viewer that displays one photo at a time, along with its comments, and allows navigation between photos using a stepper mechanism. This interface should clearly show stepping options, such as forward and backward buttons, and visually indicate when stepping is not possible (e.g., disable the backward button at the first photo). Additionally, the application should support bookmarking individual photos and sharing via URL.
Integration with the browser's navigation buttons should ensure that users can use forward and back buttons as expected. When accessing the app through a deep-linked URL to a specific photo, the stepper should function seamlessly, maintaining the integrity of the user experience.


Story number and name: 7 - Favorite Lists of Photos for Users
Story points: 6
Brief description to see the story in action: Logged-in users can mark photos as favorites, creating a personalized list accessible via a dedicated /favorites page. Photos can be unfavorited, and a distinctive button or icon next to each photo allows users to add it to their favorites. Once favorited, this button should be disabled, with a clear indicator showing the photo's favored status. The favorites page displays thumbnails of favorited photos; clicking a thumbnail opens a modal with a larger image and the photo's upload date. Users should have an easy option, like clicking an "x" on the thumbnail, to remove photos from their favorites, ensuring the removal persists even after a page refresh or re-login.
